		<p contenteditable="true">HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages.
		   Itâ€™s a combination of Hypertext, which defines the link between web pages, and Markup language,
		   which is used to define the text document within tags to structure web pages. 
		   This language is used to annotate text so that machines can understand and manipulate it accordingly.
		   HTML is human-readable and uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text

		  <li>Web development:Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files.</li> 
		  <li>Internet navigation:Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks.</li> 
		  <li>Web documentation:HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.</li></p>
